 I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize Handwritten Digits, using the
 MNIST dataset. Developed in Python with Tensor-flow/Keras, the process included important steps
 such as data preprocessing, model training, and detailed documentation of the entire work flow,
 including valuable insights from data exploration and analysis.
